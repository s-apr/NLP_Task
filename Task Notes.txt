#Write a note about what you found interesting about the similarities
between cat, monkey and banana

	I find it interesting how the algorithm categorises actual objects with an integer,
	and scores them according to how similar each given object is to one another. I am unsure how
	you would score something that often seems inherent. I find myself not being able to score many of these
	objects accurately myself.

#en_core_web_smâ€™ different from the model'en_core_web_md'.

	In terms of the scores, when comparing the 'Complaints similarity' lists from both models
	there were 16 of the same scores, and 15 differing scores. I am also prompted to use a larger
	model due to the amount of data being compared ('en_core_web_sm')
